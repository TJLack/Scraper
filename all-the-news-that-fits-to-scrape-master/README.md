# All-the-News-That-s-Fit-to-Scrape

This application demonstrates the ability to scrape information from the Wall Street Journal.  



<h2>Website functionality with Routes</h2>
This application works based on URL routes. Each of the routes below are endpoints on the URL that perform the functionality of the website. 

<h2>/scrape</h2>
<p>Performs the scrape that gathers information from https://www.wsj.com/. The data gathered is the title and link to each article on the wall street journal.</p>  

Example:
```
localhost:4000/scrape
```

<h2>/</h2>
<p>This is the landing page where the scrape material is presented. This page will be empty if the scrape route was not performed.  Here you will see a scroll bar section that shows each article. Clicking an article will open a comment section where a comment section can be filled out per article.  The article and comment section is persisting through a server.</p>

Example:
```
localhost:4000/
```
